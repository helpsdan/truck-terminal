# TRUCK TERMINAL

Hello! It is with great pleasure that I present to you the system that I developed. It was developed in the **Java**
language using **Spring** to produce the REST truck terminal management api.

# Environment configuration

**Version 8 of Java must be installed on the machine**.

- For Windows operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml)
- For Mac OS operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/help/mac_install.xml)
- For Linus operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/help/linux_install.xml)

Download this repository to your desktop or the location of your choice.

To better visualize the developed code, install an IDE of your choice but, I suggest **Intellij from
JetBrains** because I used some plugins that are available in it.

- For Windows operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
- For Mac OS operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
- For Linus operating system:
  > [Download link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux)

After completing the installation, open the project in the IDE and wait for the project dependencies to download.

It is necessary to add the **Lombok** plugin so that it does not break the application, it does not bring any great gain of
performance, but it decreases the code complexity, the number of lines and increases the quality of the code.

- To install:

> File --> Settings --> Plugins --> Install Lombok

# Running the application


To run the application, right-click on the file: **TruckTerminalApplication** which is in the
**br.com.devnaweb.trucks** and press **Run**.

You can see the application running on port **8080**. I left some data scheduled for insertion into the database
during compilation time in order to manually test the developed endpoints. To access the database, go to
for:
> [LOCALHOST](http://localhost:8080/h2)

You can also view code coverage in tests and run the application tests by right clicking on
**java** folder found under **test** and selecting the desired one or just clicking the button as below:!

# Testing available services

To test the services available, I made a Postman Collection available to facilitate.
> [Download link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

After installation, import the collection: **truck_terminal.postman_collection.json** which is at the root of the project.
> [Tutorial for importing data into Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collection-runs/working-with-data-files/)

Now feel free to test the application, all available endpoints will only work with the application running,
remember this.

# Others

In order to document the tasks produced, I created a board in **Trello** to define what I was going to do.

I make myself available for further clarification.
